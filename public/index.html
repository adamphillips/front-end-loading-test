      <h1>JS load event behaviour test</h1>
      <p>This is a test page to allow inspection of the different load events
      and how they affect interactivity</p>
      <o>At different stages in the load, events are logged to both the screen
      and the console. You will want to open the developer tools before starting
      the test in order to see the events that fire before the first paint</p>
      <p>In order to make it easier to see when the page becomes interactive, an
      artificial sleep can be inserted during the handling of each event.<p>
      <p>
        Two ways of checking for interactivity are:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>Mouse over the header - this will turn blue once css pseudo elements are working. Try this on the header above</li>
          <li>Scrolling the page</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>To run the test, enter the sleep time below and click <em>Run test</em></p>
      <form action="test.html" method="get">
        <p>
          <label for="sleepTime">Sleep for</label>
          <input name="sleepTime" value="2000" size="5" />ms
        </p>

        <button type="submit">Run test</button>
      </form>
